### Notes

####
- Steps to take:
- Manually create a new account at https://betabuild.avomd.io
- Use Postman to make a POST request to signin, retrieve token
- Use this token in all subsequent API requests

- Using a browser, open Devtools > Network panel
- Click on "create an algo" to retrieve the endpoint URL, header requirements, and body requirements
- Click on "delete an algo" to retrieve the endpoint URL, header requirements, and body requirements
- Store this data as we will use it to make API requests in TypeScript

- Include a README.md file
- Include instructions on how to install dependencies
- Include instructions on how to run the script.
- Include any configuration requirements.

####
- Review code for:
- Correctness: the automation should successfully create and delete an algo. Verify via website.
- Code quality: check for structure, maintainability, best coding practices.
- API usage: correctly identifying API endpoints
- Clarity of documentation: README.MD clearly explains setting up and running the script.
- Proactive clarification: ask questions via email.

- Send public GitHub repo to Laurence, Swain.
